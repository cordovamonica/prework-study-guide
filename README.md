This is a study guide page to hold my notes for coding bootcamp while going thru the prework. I built this to learn different aspects of a webpage and see them in action.

The study guide provides notes from each section of the bootcamp: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. When the DevTools console it opened, it shows the JavaScript that is running. There will also be a randomly selected topic from the course to start studying.
